# Pacman

Pacman is a remake of the classic Pacman game, inspired by the pandemic. It was created using the SFML library.

## Overview of gameplay

The player controls Pacman's movements. Pacman earns points by eating the vaccines. To win, all vaccines must be collected.

The equivalent of the ghosts are viruses. They move randomly across the board â€“ when they encounter Pacman, he loses one life (if the number of lives drops to 0, the game is over) and the board resets.

In addition to the classic Pacman rules, a bonus system has been implemented. Bonuses generate randomly on the board and can either help or hinder the player.

At the beginning of the game, the player can choose the difficulty level, their name, and the board layout (one of five predefined options or random). The game begins with a manual, and at the end, the last 10 rounds are displayed.
